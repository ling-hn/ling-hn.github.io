*Eduard Kärger, born in Althöfchen in 1843,  was a high school math teacher (Gymnasiallehrer) in Poznan. We found an announcement of his dissertation on an academica news. He got a doctorate degree in philosophy at University Göttingen in 1875. Detailed investigation of Kärger's life can be found [here](https://ling-hn.github.io/projects/karger-project-1/).*

Despite extensive investigation, there remains a lack of concrete evidence that Kärger ever visited Göttingen or registered at Göttingen University. By all accounts, he appears to have spent the majority of his study in Berlin. At the time of his promotion, he lived in Poznan, 600 kilometers away from Göttingen. 

This raises an intriguing question: How, then, did he manage to obtain a doctorate from Göttingen? What circumstances allowed him to pursue or receive this credential from a University with which he seemingly had no direct ties? To answer these questions, we must first understand how one would acquire a doctorate in 19th-century Prussia and what studying for a PhD at that time entailed. Interestingly, we uncover a common practice known as "Promotion *in absentia*", which raises further doubts about the legitimacy of Kärger's PhD... 

### Promotion in 19th-century Prussia

Pre-modern societies shaped universities and their internal order, but lacked the state's capacity to treat individuals as abstract entities. Degrees marked academic progress within a multi-tiered system, but also carried quasi-public legal effects, elevating both academic qualifications and social status. By the early modern period, the social and economic significance of the doctorate often outweighed its academic value, solidifying its role as a status symbol. From the late 18th century, degree awarding and examinations gradually came under state control, trying to have standarized rules among Universities.[^hammerp173][^Ringer]

Disputation (oral debate/defense) has been one of the most important requirement for a doctorate. Disputation was a key practice in European academia and public disputations were the primary form of scientific exchange. Doctorate disputations were central to demonstrating a candidate's knowledge, analytical thinking, and argumentation.[^2][^3] Ahead of the disputation, thesis announcements were posted publicly, stating date, location, topic of the disputation and listed arguments. Doctoral candidates often focused solely on their disputation. A formal, written dissertation being provided by their supervisor, often without the latters name being mentioned on the cover.[^4][^Grigat]

In the 18th century, the legitimacy of oral defenses began to decline, and debates arose about the introduction of formal dissertations. Procedures and formatting standards for dissertation submissions varied across institutions and were often inconsistent.[^5] It became common to compromise by conducting defenses in one's native language instead of Latin, presenting theses with noted arguments rather than a formal dissertation, or relying on rehearsed defenses rather than engaging in open and free discussion.[^6]

In late 18th- and early 19th-century Prussia, efforts were made to standardize doctoral requirements. As a result, doctoral candidates were required to write formal dissertations instead of the simplified theses traditionally used for disputations. By the 1830s, some universities required the public dissemination of dissertations as part of the doctoral process. In 1858, the University of Berlin, which was at the forefront of standarizing the promotion process, proposed that future doctorates include oral exams, debates, and the publication of a dissertation. However, these rules were not always strictly enforced, and many cases still involved compromises and deviations from the formal requirements.[^7]

### Promotion *in absentia*

In the late 18th century, most candidates pursued a doctorate not for its academic merit, but for social prestige, class advancement, or as a prerequisite for non-academic careers. For many who would go on to work outside of academia, only an oral exam was required, and were exempt from the dissertation and disputation. Additionally, doctoral certificates were gradually being issued without requirement for a traditional ceremony, allowing candidates to switch from oral to written examinations without needing to be physically present at the university. Certificates could even be issued by post. This practice was known as *Promotion in absentia*. [^Grigat][^8][^9]

Naturally, promotion in absentia faced criticism from the outset, yet it nevertheless became a common practice. The root of this phenomenon laid in the financial state of the university. With rising inflation, currency devaluation, and declining student numbers, the already precarious income situation for professors worsened significantly (time). Absentee candidates, aware that faculties are reliant on their fees, often negotiated not only on the requirements to obtain a degree but also on the financial terms. This dynamic even led to the commercialization of the process, turning it into what has been termed "dissertation factories".[^10] 

Some financially struggling, mostly non-Prussian, universities were notorious for allowing *Promotion in absentia*, awarding doctorates in large numbers. The University of Jena was particularly notable, granting nearly 1,800 doctorates between 1832 and 1865, with only 19 not awarded *in absentia*. For comparison, this is about four times the combined total of Berlin and Munich. Other non-Prussian Universities including Leipzig, Giessen, and Rostock, were also known for allowing promotion in absentia.[^3][^9]

In Göttingen, Promotion *in absentia* was also a common practice since 18th century. [^10] Christoph Meiners recorded the inconsistencies in dissertation requirements for *absentia* or private doctorates between 1801-1802: some candidates wrote dissertations, others submitted theses, while some provided no written work at all.[^11] Later, Göttingen was incorporated into Prussia in 1866 following the Austro-Prussian War. During the period 1872 - 1865, Göttingen conferred over 300 doctorates, surpassing both Berlin and Munich.[^9]

### Famous examples of Promotion *in absentia*

Berlin University was the first to set narrow requirements to obtain a doctorate degree, in an attempt to reform the qualifiation rules. This may have led to students from Berlin Universities switching to other (non-)Prussian Universities that were increasingly successful in offering their degrees with more lenient requirements than that of the Prussian ones. 

#### Karl Marx

One famous example is Berlin graduate Karl Marx, who evidently did not want to go through the hassle of writing a dissertation in Latin, and a disputation and oral examination in Berlin.[^Raschep323] Like many of his fellow students before and after him, he was awarded his doctorate in Jena in 1841 (at the age of 23!) solely on the basis of a German treatise that he had submitted by post. Interestingly, his dissertation was noted as being „vorzüglich würdig“ ("exceptionally worthy"). [^Bauer]

#### Carl Friedrich Gauß

Another famous celebrity who got their doctorate in absentia is Carl Friedrich Gauß. He was born in Braunschweig of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1777 and later studied at the Georgia Augusta in Göttingen with sponsorship from the Duke of Brunswick. In 1799 he finished his promotion in absentia at the University Helmstedt under Johann Friedrich Pfaff with the first complete proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. Possibly because his sponsor, the Duke of Brunswick, did not want him to get his doctorate outside of Brunswick. (#petty)  [^Gauss1] [^Gauss2]

#### Sofya Kowalewskaja

Another example of Promotion *in absentia* was Sofya Wassiljewna Kowalewskaja, a female Russian mathematician. She came to Germany in 1869 to study Math. After being rejected by University Berlin due to her gender, she studied under the private tutorage of Prof. Karl Weierstraß from 1870 to 1874. With recommendation by Weierstrass, she submitted three articles — on partial differential equations, Saturn’s rings, and elliptic integrals — to the University of Göttingen and obtained a doctorate in absentia with summa cum laude. [^sofia] 

It is worth mentioning that Sofya's close friend, Yulia Lermontova, also received a PhD in chemistry from the University of Göttingen not long after Sofya. Unlike Sofya, Yulia held a public defense and passed with excellent results. [^25] Sofya was the first woman to receive a PhD in mathematics in Germany and the second female PhD graduate from the University of Göttingen. The first had been in 1787, when Dorothea Schlözer was awarded the first PhD in philosophy by Göttingen university, making her the first female PhD in Germany. This suggests that the University of Göttingen may have been relatively progressive in granting women PhDs.


### Kärger being suspicious ...

Eduard Kärger's doctorate degree now appears highly suspicious. Fortunately we can still find Kärger's printed dissertation in Göttingens historical library. His dissertation includes (1) Cover, (2) Acknowledgement page, and (3) Main text with one additional page of figures. [^23]

His dissertation, titled "Investigation of the Path of a Point Attracted or Repelled by the Force \\(\frac{k}{r^4}\\), where \\(k\\) is a Constant and \\(r\\) denotes the Distance of the Attracted Point from the Center of Force," focuses on solving differential equations of elliptic integrals using, for the time, advanced integration methods. In his main text, he discusses 6 conditions on solving elliptic integrals of partial differential equations, without division into sections or chapters. The dissertation was written as a single monograph. At the end of the dissertation, there is an additional page heft with figures showing the trajectories of an object as described by the equations derived in the text.

In the late 19th century, the George-August University Göttingen added a printed dissertation or thesis to the set of requirements to obtain a doctorate degree, but again, there was wiggleroom. The cover design generally included:[^Tutkenp89137]

- A statement indicating the degree and the institution granting it.
- The date, month, and year of the debate.
- A description of the type of debate (e.g., "open debate").
- The name of the respondent or author, often including their place of birth. Sometimes also the name of supervisor.
- The author's academic affiliations, where relevant (e.g., philosophy seminars, preparatory colleges).
- The printing location and name of the printer, usually in Göttingen.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJPRQA0Jye.png)[^Tutkenp110]

Typically, the dissertation had to be printed before the defense, usually by the printing press in Göttingen. Karger, again, is not following the rules. His dissertation is printed in Greifswald, near Rostock. *(Greisfwald 1875. Druck der Universitäts-Buchdruckerei von E. W. Kunike)* His dissertation cover contains most of the required elements, but not the type of disputation (probably because there was none), nor the name of his supervisor.

On the second page, he dedicates his work to Prof. Erler, who was his math teacher in school in Züllichau. He may have been the one who inspired Kärger to pursue the study of mathematics. However, Prof. Erler was never a registered scholar or professor at the University of Göttingen. Could Kärger's supervisor have been Prof. Karl Weierstrass, who was his mathematics professor in Berlin? Kärger's picture is also found in Weierstrass' 70th birthday photo album. Records show that, although Prof. Weierstrass was an external member of the Göttingen academic community (Auswärtiges Mitglied von Niedersächsische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen), he never lectured there.

Regarding the originality of his work, similar models with the order of \\(r^n\\), where \\(n = -4\\), with focus on the derivation of **elliptic integral** of differential equations, had previously been published by two different author, one in French by A.-M. Legendre for  \\(n = 0, 3, 5, -4, -5 ,-7\\) [^Legendre] and the other by Stader written in Latin and published in Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik for \\(n = -3, -4, -5, -6, -7\\) [^Stader] [^24]. It remains unclear whether Kärger introduced new integration methods, though it seems highly likely. 

Notably, Prof. Weierstrass and one of his most famous students, Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya, made significant contributions to the study of elliptic integrals. In 1874, she submitted three articles as dissertations to the University of Göttingen and was awarded her doctorate in absentia, with a recommendation from Prof. Weierstrass. On her dissertation cover, she did not mention her supervisor, but dedicated her work to Prof. Weierstrass on the next acknowledgement page. Nonetheless, her work was later submitted and published in August of the same year to Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik. [^25] [^26]
 
### Conclusion

The investigation into Kärger’s life has come to an end. What began as a random discovery—a casual glance at a book in the Upper Lusatian Library of Sciences in Görlitz (Oberlausitzische Bibliothek der Wissenschaften) — gradually evolved into an in-depth pursuit, or perhaps, an unintentional "stalking" of Kärger through the annals of time. 

Initially, my involvement was more passive, as I enjoyed the daily updates of discoveries shared by my co-author. However, as more details of Kärger’s life emerged, we sensed something was missing — ***a connection between Kärger and the University of Göttingen***. This led me to explore the academic promotion practices of 19th-century Prussia, uncovering several intriguing sources, as detailed in the reference section. It was somewhat disappointing to find that Kärger was likely not a legitimate doctor, but in the historical context, such thing of "*Gymnasiumprofessor*" [^Grigat] were not uncommon. But overall, he is more a teacher rather a scholar. It is also interesting to realize that even Göttingen University, always renowned for its academic excellence, had such inconsistencies in its past.

Overall, this investigation has been a rewarding journey. In addition to reading Kärger's dissertation — yes, we digitized and translated it into German — we borrowed books from the historical libraries of Göttingen and grappled with dense German research articles. Despite the challenges posed by language barriers (my lack of Latin, and difficulty reading German in old Goethe script), and the lack of digital information, the process of discovery has been thoroughly engaging, even *addictive*. Maybe we just stop here for now.
